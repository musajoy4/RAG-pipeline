POLICY \\nNASA policy is that any information concerning court actions, or administrative or regulatory proceedings, brought on\\nbehalf of, or against, the United States, NASA, or any NASA current or former employee, resulting from alleged\\nNASA activities, are promptly reported to the Office of the General Counsel at the appropriate Center. Activities\\nwithout a legal advisor onsite or readily available should contact directly the Headquarters Office of the General\\nCounsel (General Law) at (202) 358-2465. NASA policy is also that service of process for private actions is generally\\nvoluntary; however, Field Centers may provide otherwise. Therefore, service of process onsite upon NASA\\nemployees and contractor employees, in their personal capacity (that is an allegation, complaint, or dispute not\\narising from their official NASA duties) may be voluntarily accepted by the individual, except if provided for otherwise\\nby Center-specific regulation. \\n2.

These include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n(1) Naming NASA as a defendant or respondent or making allegations directed at an official activity of NASA\\npersonnel, or activities involving NASA contractors or subcontractors. \\n(2) Making allegations or assertions involving NASA's nonappropriated fund activities. \\nNPD 2010.1E -- main\\nThis document does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as\\nincorporated into a contract.
